# Location Finder
# Location Finder Project
This is a JavaScript  workout tracker application  built in using HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, Geolocation API and Leaflet Library.
It allows the user to add running or cycling workouts, with the distance, duration, and other metrics.
The application uses the browser's geolocation API to get the user's current location and displays a map with markers for each workout.
The user can click on a workout marker to see the workout details, and the application allows the user to toggle between displaying the elevation gain
and cadence for cycling and running workouts, respectively.
The application uses event listeners to handle form submissions, type changes, and clicks on workout markers.
It also uses local storage to store the workout data, allowing the user to reload the page without losing their data.
